# Manufacturing Engineering Portfolio — Nate Karau (replace name)

This repository contains a clean, mobile-first manufacturing engineering portfolio you can host with **GitHub Pages**.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — single-page portfolio with sections: About, Skills, Case Studies, Experience, Downloads, Contact.
- `styles.css` — lightweight CSS with responsive grid and card styles.
- `projects/PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md` — template for writing detailed project case studies.

## How to use
1. Replace placeholder text, images, and links in `index.html` with your content.
2. Create a `projects/` folder and add markdown files for each project (or link to project subpages).
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repository Settings → Pages → Set source to `main` (root) or `gh-pages`.
5. (Optional) Add your resume `resume.pdf` to repository root and link it from the site.

## Tips for a manufacturing portfolio
- Lead with measurable results (“cut cycle time 23%”, “reduced scrap 18%”).
- Include CAD screenshots, BOM excerpts, process flow diagrams, and FEA / test results.
- For each project include: problem, role, constraints, approach, tools (SolidWorks/Inventor/AutoCAD, tolerance analysis, GD&T), results (numbers), lessons learned.
- Keep case studies ~300–800 words, with strong visuals and callouts.
