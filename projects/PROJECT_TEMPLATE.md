# Project Title — Short subtitle

**Role:** (e.g., Team lead, Manufacturing Engineer)  
**Tools:** SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Excel, Shop (CNC, MIG/TIG)  
**Timeline:** Jan 2024 — Apr 2024  
**Outcome:** (e.g., Cycle time -23%, scrap -18%, $6k/yr savings)

## Summary
1–2 sentence summary of the problem and the high-level result.

## Problem & Constraints
- What was broken or inefficient?
- Production rates, tolerance constraints, test requirements, safety, budget, or timeline constraints.

## My Role & Team
- What you owned (design, test, manufacturing planning).
- Team composition & stakeholders (operators, machinists, suppliers).

## Approach
1. Analysis and data collection: time studies, drawings, FMEA.
2. Design iterations: CAD screenshots, fixtures, tolerance analysis.
3. Validation: prototypes, gage checks, run-offs, pilot builds.
4. Implementation: cost analysis, operator training, control plan updates.

## Key Artefacts
- Link to CAD screenshots or STEP files.
- Process flow diagram (PDF).
- BOM excerpt or PPM data.
- Test data (summary).

## Results
- Quantified improvements (numbers preferred).
- Lessons learned and next steps.

## Files
- `drawings/` — released drawing PDFs
- `reports/` — DFMEA, control plan, test report
- `cad/` — STEP or native CAD files (if shareable)
